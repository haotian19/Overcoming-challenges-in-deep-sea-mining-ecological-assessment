# Overcoming Challenges in Deep-Sea Mining Ecological Assessment — Code Repository

This repository contains the complete analysis code, scripts, and supplementary materials for the study:

**“Overcoming Challenges in Deep-Sea Mining Ecological Assessment”**

The project integrates environmental DNA (eDNA)–based biodiversity analysis with machine learning models to improve ecological assessment and impact prediction for deep-sea mining regions.

## 📘 Overview

This repository includes the full workflow used in the paper, covering:

- **Data preprocessing** of eDNA, environmental variables, and sediment parameters  
- **Model training and evaluation** using:  
  - LightGBM  
  - XGBoost  
  - Random Forest
- **Model comparison** based on MAE, RMSE, MAPE
- **SHAP-based model explainability**  
- **Feature contribution analysis** for deep-sea ecosystems  
- **Figure generation** 

All scripts are modularized for clarity and reproducibility.
